</p>

This project was made to help me track my time when working on different projects for different people and also better estimate project task times with reference data.

### Built With
Here is the tech I used to put together this software.
* [Electron](https://electronjs.org)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

If you'd like to have the Time-Tracker on your machine (for fun or whatever), make sure you have the following prerequisites before trying to do installation.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)


### Installation

1. Once you've cloned Time-Tracker onto your machine, cd into the Time-Tracker directory and run: `npm install`. This will install all necessary dependencies.
2. Next run: `npm start` in the terminal window and Time-Tracker will now open up.
